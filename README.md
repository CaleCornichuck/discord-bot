# discord-bot
A simple Discord bot that accesses the Twitter API to print out the 5 most recent tweets of a given user.
# Getting Started
For this code to work, you will first need to download tweepy, discord, and dotenv for python. This can be done using pip. You will also need the token for the Discord bot this will be linked to. You then need to get the Bearer Token, Consumer Key, Consumer Secret Key, Access Token, and Access Secret Token from the Twitter API. Once you have all of these, you will need to create a .env file that will have all of these items in it. Once all of this is done, the bot will be able to be started and work.
